#8 42.25 [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
#8 42.25 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#8 42.25 declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#8 42.25 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#8 42.25 node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.
#8 42.25 
#8 42.25 babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
#8 42.25 is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
#8 42.25 ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#8 42.25 your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
