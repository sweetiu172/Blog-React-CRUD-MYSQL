#9 35.78 [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
#9 35.78 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#9 35.78 declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#9 35.78 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#9 35.78 node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

#9 35.78 babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
#9 35.78 is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
#9 35.78 ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#9 35.78 your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
