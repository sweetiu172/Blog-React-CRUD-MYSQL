#7 59.90 [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
#7 59.90 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#7 59.90 declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#7 59.90 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#7 59.90 node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

#7 59.90 babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
#7 59.90 is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
#7 59.90 ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#7 59.90 your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
