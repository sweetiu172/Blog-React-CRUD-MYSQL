#10 41.99 [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
#10 41.99 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#10 41.99 declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#10 41.99 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#10 41.99 node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.
#10 41.99 
#10 41.99 babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
#10 41.99 is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
#10 41.99 ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#10 41.99 your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
